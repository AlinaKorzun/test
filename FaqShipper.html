                        <p class="question">What are the advantages of working with fliit as a partner?</p>
                        <p class="answer">We relief you from all the hard and annoying stuff related to food logistics
                            and help you to find the perfect solution particularly in short-haul transportation with our
                            broad carrier partner network.</p>
                        <p class="question">What is the difference between fliit and a traditional haulage company?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Especially with the special requirements of food logistics, traditional
                            haulage companies have a very stiff setup and often can hardly handle singular requests.
                            Based on our network and our asset-light model however, we can react to highly individual
                            transport requests of any size quickly and flexibly</p>
                        <p class="question">Can I only book the service of fliit within Germany?</p>
                        <p class="answer">At the moment fliit focuses on national food transportation. Nevertheless,
                            feel free to talk to us about international requests and we will help you within our
                            possibilities and provide you with useful advice.</p>
                        <p class="question">Does the service of fliit cost?</p>
                        <p class="answer">The use of website, price calculator, counseling and contact to the team are
                            completely free of charge.</p>
                        <p class="question">Will my data be transmitted to third parties?</p>
                        <p class="answer">All data that we receive and collect from you will only be used to process and
                            complete your requests and demanded services. That means your data will neither be sold nor
                            leased to third parties or be provided for third party use for advertising or market
                            research</p>

                        <h3>Booking Process</h3>
                        <p class="question">How do I book a transportation with fliit?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Simply contact us at phone number or send a request to info@fliit.de.
                            Alternatively, you can directly use the calculator on our website to have a price estimation
                            for your transport calculated. We will contact you then to clarify all the details in a
                            personalztalk.</p>
                        <p class="question">What type of transportation can be executed through fliit?</p>
                        <p class="answer">We specialize in the transportation of any kind of food in distribution
                            transportation. Nevertheless, with our broad carrier partner network that comprises many
                            different vehicles we can also handle other requests in special cases.</p>
                        <p class="question">Is there a minimum amount for transport requests?</p>
                        <p class="answer">No! Opposite to common haulage companies we can already handle requests
                            starting from very small size such as one box, one EPAL or one roll cage. For more
                            information please call us or send a request via e-mail and we talk about the possibilities
                            and details with you.</p>
                        <p class="question">Does fliit have a EU license?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Since we do not handle any vehicles or drive ourselves, the EU license does
                            not apply to us. However, we ensure that all our carriers that execute your transport own a
                            valid EU license</p>
                        <p class="question">Does fliit have an IFS or comparable certification?</p>
                        <p class="answer">Since we do not own any vehicles or drive them ourselves, the IFS license does
                            not apply to us. However, we ensure that our carrier partners have various certifications.
                            Simply contact us at tel number or <a href="">info@fliit.de </a>to find out which
                            certificates are
