                    <h2 style="text-align: left;">What & Why</h2>
                    <p>Hello Fresh developed a novel, fast-growing fresh convenience food concept: Hello Fresh Go
                        provides
                        vending machine fridges with fresh and healthy meals and snacks. Of course, the daily, efficient
                        restocking and control of these fridges is a key factor for Hello Fresh.</p>
                    <img src="img/pic15.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 45%;">
                    <img src="img/pic16.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 45%;">
                    <!--style="max-width: 100%;"-->
                    <!--in case you need bottom margin add class="padding_bottom"-->
                </div>

                <div class="big_block flex align-center justify-between">
                    <h2 style="text-align: left;">The Challenge </h2>
                    <p>The novelty of the logistics needed, that required immense flexibility and a joint development
                        and gradual definition of the actual service: daily varying deliveries, the restocking of the
                        fridges on top of the actual transportation, taking stock and marking available products, as
                        well as the disposal of products that are out of date. In addition, flexible commissioning is
                        needed that adapts to daily requirements: Delivery amounts change daily within existing fridges
                        and due to the strong growth.</p>
                    <p>Usual logistics providers are unable or unwilling to take the challenge or suggest expensive and
                        inefficient solutions. Fliit enthusiastically responded as one of the first ones with an
                        individualized offer.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Our Solution </h2>
                    <p>Based on out zero asset model we could choose and adapt the right carrier on a daily basis.
                        Thereby we created a specialized logistics solution that is flexible, reliable and allows for
                        all necessary additional services as nobody else could have done. The flexibility of the model
                        is essential and unique until today and immensely contributed to the successful rollout of Hello
                        Fresh Go. </p>

                        <li>
                            fliit takes care of driver training and even joined the drivers on their tours to ensure
                            that standards of Hello Fresh Go are met.
                        </li>
                        <li>Jointly, delivery processes were improved continually, especially with the help of the
                            diverse and exact data delivered by fliit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Thereby, Hello Fresh Go could increase the efficiency of its processes as well as the
                            accuracy of its forecasts.

                        <li>The documentation and controls by fliit also make quality and complaint management a lot
                            easier for Hello Fresh.
